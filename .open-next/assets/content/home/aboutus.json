    "text": "For over 40 years, the Brown Ultimate program has churned out elite players and coaches all across the country. Brown Ultimate, commonly referred to as “The Program,” claims four men’s national titles (2000, 2005, 2019, and 2024) and five Callahan winners. BMo returned to College Nationals in 2018 after a 10-year hiatus, thanks to the superior coaching of Sam Lehman and Jake Smart, whose commitment and acuity have taken BMo from kangaroo court to nationals contender."
