It would have made sense for this team, with all 12 (?) of its rookies, to be a little rough around the edges. Maybe even serving more as a development year. Instead, we swept our regular season tournaments: Florida Warmup, Smoky Mountain Invite, and Easterns. We then walked through sectionals and regionals, taking care of business against the region’s best. It wasn’t always pretty (needing to break somewhere between 2 and a million times in a row to beat NC State on double game point), but we usually got lucky and found a way to win – every game in fact, except our first of the season, against Minnesota. Arriving at Nationals, we knew we had put in the work to be able to beat any team in the field. After an up and down opening win against Cal Poly, things started clicking.

In the Music City, we joined BMo Alum Eli Motycka at Martin’s Bar-B-Que (unfortunately no relation to our dear Martin Trouilloud) for a delicious lunch. Following that, we battled hurricane-level winds as we drove across the state to Knoxville—winds almost as frightening as those on the MK field during a zone practice.
