Excitement abounded. After much car bonding, we arrived at our tournament lodging: a quaint seaside Airbnb for most and Zach Merrill’s wonderful house for the elites. Everyone convened at the Airbnb to hear some inspirational words from the captains, and then to make our traditional spray-painted jerseys.",

Since that glorious day, the Hellfish have achieved the pinnacle of student-athlete-dom as we balanced the grueling schedule of Training Week, finals, and NBA conference finals. We perfected our sets over the two practices per day and grew ever closer as teammates, knowing that this current iteration of BMo had a lifetime measured in days.",

Of course, we have also been enjoying the increased practice intensity and running that accompany our aspirations. Additionally, we are extremely honored and excited to announce our 2023 Callahan Nominee, Leo Gordon! Leo has been a wondrous player for BMo, on and off the field. You may have seen his incredible play, but did you know about his work as our Community Well-being Chair or his awesome dance moves?! There is no one more deserving, and it is a delight to call him my teammate.",

This year’s edition came with a must-do, push-has-come-to-shove mission to earn a bid for our region (more on that later).",

Yet again we rose far earlier than the sun, flying down for a pit stop in St. Louis before heading to Nashville. In the Music City, we joined BMo Alum Eli Motycka at Martin’s Bar-B-Que (unfortunately no relation to our dear Martin Trouilloud) for a delicious lunch. Following that, we battled hurricane-level winds as we drove across the state to Knoxville—winds almost as frightening as those on the MK field during a zone practice. Everyone made it to the hotel safe and sound where we all promptly headed straight to bed, excited for the games to come. Unlike FloWo, we came into SMI decently healthy and hoped to build chemistry with almost all of our pieces in play.",

In what may be a historic first for the team, we actually flew into our destination city (Tampa) rather than our traditional several-hour commute from the airport to the field. And even more inspiring, our hotel couldn’t have been closer to both the field complex and Busch Gardens.",

				"text": "We really began this season at the end of January, without the usual October to December tinkering and bonding that the team goes through absent a fall championship. It would have made sense for this team, with all 12 (?) of its rookies, to be a little rough around the edges. Maybe even serving more as a development year. Instead, we swept our regular season tournaments: Florida Warmup, Smoky Mountain Invite, and Easterns. We then walked through sectionals and regionals, taking care of business against the region’s best. It wasn’t always pretty (needing to break somewhere between 2 and a million times in a row to beat NC State on double game point), but we usually got lucky and found a way to win – every game in fact, except our first of the season, against Minnesota. Arriving at Nationals, we knew we had put in the work to be able to beat any team in the field. After an up and down opening win against Cal Poly, things started clicking. While Evan Lepler will tell you all about Jacques’ pinpoint blades and John’s first step, our undefeated run to the final was fueled by the contributions of the entirety of our roster...",
